# Demo module to get a response code from any URL using Guzzle in Drupal 8

You can use this example class/module to get a response code from a URL in Drupal 8 using Guzzle, which is Drupal 8's way of sending HTTP requests. This could be an alternative to implementing cURL in a class that's native to Drupal 8 core.
